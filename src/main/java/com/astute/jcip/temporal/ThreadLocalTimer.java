/**
 * The {@link ThreadLocal} based stop watch is safe to use with multiple threads as it will time each thread's call
 * between {@link #reset()} (or construction) and {@link #lap()}. It is intended to use one shared {@link com.astute.jcip.temporal.Clock}.
 * For example, {@link com.astute.jcip.temporal.RealClock} but you could use a clock based on {@link ThreadLocal} if you need to provide different
 * clocks per thread (although, outside of a testing context, I'm not sure why you'd want to).
